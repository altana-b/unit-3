# DogChat User Stories
## Write detailed user stories for a.) a new dog to sign up for the app

*	The dog is not signed up and is viewing the splash page. The dog clicks the “create a new account” button on the splash page.
*	After that the dog is viewing the sign up page, which has the following textboxes to enter information needed for registration: e-mail, name, surname, password. After filling in the textboxes, the dog can click the “finish sign up” button.
*	If the e-mail is already in use for another account, it cannot be used for creating a new one. If the dog enters such an e-mail, an error message with a request to type another e-mail will be displayed. Display another error message if the email is invalid.
*	Once the dog finishes setting up a new account, he/she will be redirected to the feed page.

## Write detailed user stories for b.) a dog to be able to become friends with another dog (for instance, a dog could make a friend request, and another dog could accept it, and so on)

*	Suppose Dog A is logged in
*	Dog A wants to add Dog B to friends. Ways in which it is possible:
*	1) Dog A sees Dog B’s profile / comment / post on the feed page. Dog A clicks on Dog B’s name or profile picture and is redirected to their profile page.
*	2) Dog A types in Dog B’s name into the search bar and is redirected to the search results page. Search results page: if Dog B’s profile is found, display Dog B’s profile preview. If not found, display error message with a suggestion to check spelling, etc. Dog A clicks on Dog B’s profile preview and is redirected to Dog B’s profile page
*	On Dog B’s profile page, Dog A sees the “send a friend request” button. After clicking on this button, a page with a textbox for optional comment appears. If Dog A wants to add some comment to their request, it can do so here. If no comment is needed, Dog A presses the “send a friend request” button. After that the space of button is replaced with a box that says “friend request sent”.
*	Dog B is logged in and sees a friend request from Dog A from the menu on the feed page or notifications page or My friends page.
*	After clicking on the Dog A’s request, Dog B is redirected to the “Friend requests” page. Here Dog B sees Dog A’s profile preview, mutual friends (if any) and two buttons – Add to friends or Reject request.
*	If Dog B accepts the requests, both Dog A and B can see each other on the “My friends” page.

* After typing the message and (optionally) adding attachments, Dog A clicks the “send message” button, after which the “your message is sent” window appears.
